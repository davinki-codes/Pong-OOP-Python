4. Game continues for set rounds
5. Highest points wins

## Configuration

* `number_of_rounds` in `main.py` (default: 3)
* Screen size: `screen.setup(width=600, height=600)`

## File Structure

* `main.py` - Main loop and events
* `paddle_setup.py` - Paddle logic
* `pong_and_score.py` - Ball physics and scoreboard

## Requirements

* Python 3.x
* turtle module (standard library)
